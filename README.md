Compile
Make sure all code files and the terminal are in the same directory. In the
terminal write "make all" without quotation marks. This will create a file called "line_processor". 
To see the compiler flags used to compile, please see the makefile. 

Execute
Once the "line_processor" file is created, in the terminal simply write "./line_processor".
